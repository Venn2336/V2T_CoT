When interpreting such medical images, an 'abnormality' is often characterized by areas of altered density or structure compared to what is expected of normal tissue. In the context of lung pathology, an abnormality can manifest as areas of consolidation, nodules, masses, or cysts, which generally appear as either darker (less dense, could indicate air) or lighter (more dense, could indicate solid or liquid material) than the surrounding lung parenchyma. In the provided image, we observe an area of altered density in the right lung, which indeed looks lighter compared to the dark, air-filled spaces of the normal lung tissue around it. This suggests the presence of an abnormality in the right lung. The area in the left seems within normal variance upon casual inspection, and no similar pattern of altered density is immediately apparent compared to the surrounding tissue. Hence, the explanation focuses on the differences in tissue density to determine the location of the abnormality.",
